#Tetris

###How to Play

---

Use the :arrow_left: and :arrow_right: keys to move the tetris block. Use the :arrow_up: key to rotate the blocks. Use the :arrow_down: key to drop the block more quickly towards the bottom of the screen.

The game will begin speeding up after you've cleared a sufficient number of rows. Enjoy!
